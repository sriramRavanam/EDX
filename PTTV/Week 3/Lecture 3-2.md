# Note taking, inventory

## Notes and Inventory

* starts with recon and continues to the end of our test
* for each inventory item or finding,  
    * explain how it was found, tools and commands used to find it
    * attach information such as the raw output, sceenshots, attachments

* this will lead to the report, best to perform this once.

* Notes help us keep track of activities

## Note Taking

* when performing large tests, we need to organize, visualize, search and parse data
* notepad++ is tough to use for inventory of thousands of machines
* OneNote, Cherrytree, Joplin
* hierarchies, multiple tabs and sections
* organizing subnets, hosts, targets

* Dradis Framework - pro tools

## Collaboration Tool for Pen Testing Teams

* Jira, Dradis, Sharepoint
* Avoids configuration control for people contributing to the same host or writeup
* Ensures secure note taking and proper protection
* Check-ins during a test ensure backups
* Allows for testing machines to be wiped on-site, only physically ecure and protect the note-taking server

## Using our Inventory

* First review notes on previous sections
* Find what targets are interesting
* figure out next steps to lead to exploitation and impacts

* Notes will contribute the bulk of the report

* Keep notes on a separate machine from the testing machine
