1. Vulnerability
    A lack of control, weakness that could be exploited for gain. (administrative / technical)
    unintentional consequenses that are not intended

    Opportunity for a threat

2. Exploit
    * A threat that weaponizes code or an application, to take advantage of a weakness for the purpose of having un-intended effect to a target that would otherwise be impossible. (unintenede by owner, unauthorized)

3. Asset
    * Something that holds value, not necessarily money, but could be proprietary information, etc.

A *vulnerability* that might have an *exploit* may expose an *asset*


* Threat
    * something that causes our system, network harm
    
* Threat source
    * Adversarial threats - actor - human
    * Non Adversarial threats - agent - environmental / accidental
    * Attributes - Posture / Location, skill level, resources, intention and motivation.

* Adversarial Threat Postures - 
    * *Insider Threat* - internal to organization (Employees)
    * *Nearsider Threat* - Physically close to the system but no system access.
    * *Outsider Threat* - no physical access, outside adversary. Through internet , wireless or physical attacks.

* Threat event
    * event that harms the target. Maliciouse actions. natural disasters, dist failure, employee negligence. 
    

* Hacking 
    * Using a vulnerability in a deliberate way to create effects that are against the original intention or design.

* Ethical Hacking
    * Authorized behaviour and actions to identify vulnerabilities of a system.

* Security Audit.
    * Regulatory requirements for finance, corporate, government, or military systems.
    * A checklist of security controls 
    * usually automatic.

# TESTS

* White Box/ Crystal box tests
    * we have full access to networks and systems, configurations, root access, source code
    * more detailed findings but not as in depth as black box

* Black Box Testing
    * No details on target, system, network, applicaiton or asset 
    * may rely on open source intelligence, social engineering
    * may target all the exposures but will go in depthg in certain vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
    * most accurate to mimicking what an outsider real-world attacks can do.

* Grey box test
    * some components of the white box and black box.

* Blue Team
    * almost entirely on the defending side but may perform tests to better secure the system.
    * works with the defenders (organization). 
    * protect from attacks.
    * WHITE BOX TESTING mainly

* Red Team
    * Black Box style of penetration test.
    * assess the security.
    * may test the blue teams in controlled environments.
    * social engineering and may assess physical security.
    * helps organization respond quicker and better to attacks.


# GOALS

* Purpose of a *PenTest* is to help secure the target system. 
* Recommendations and fixes.
* Describing and Prioritize flaws and how to fix them.
